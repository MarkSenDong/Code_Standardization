<br>
**3. .gitignore**<br>
If you want to upload local files to github, but you would like to ignore some specific file types from uploading, you can select the file type to be ignored here.<br>
<br>
**4. Choosing an appropriate open source license**<br>
If you would like to publish your code one day to the public, in order to avoid copyright infringement or other issues, you can select a default open source lisnece to go with your repo.<br>

**5. README.md**<br>
It is usually mandatory to include a README.md file in your repo, just like in this repo.<br>
The file should provide an introduction or description of the repo, *what it is, what it does, how does it work and what it includes...*<br>
It has different syntax than normal text editing or word.<br>
