# Code Standardization
This repository provides an overview of code standardisation for both Matlab and Python.

The scope of this repository should include:<br>
<b>1.</b> How to write code according to the official recommended style guide, including variable naming conventions<br>
<b>2.</b> How to effectively comment your code<br>
<b>3.</b> How to write description and helper document for your customised functions<br>
<b>4.</b> How to upload and manage your code with github<br>

## Matlab users, please start with the powerpoint presentation:
  https://github.com/MarkSenDong/Code_Standardization/blob/master/matlab_coding_standardisation.pptx<br>
  <br>
  
## Matlab example codes:
  For an example of a script, please referring to the following .m script in the repository:<br>
  https://github.com/MarkSenDong/Code_Standardization/blob/master/matlab_code_documentation_example.m<br>
  <br>
  For an example of a function, please referring to the following .m script in the repository:<br>
  https://github.com/MarkSenDong/Code_Standardization/blob/master/image_reorganisation_pronia.m<br>
  You can access the header information of the matlab function by typing:<br>
  <pre><i>help function_name;</i></pre><br>
  
## Python example codes:
  For a comprehensive example, please referring to the following .py script in the repository:<br>

  <b>How to document source code responsibly, Andrew Goldis</b><br>
  This blog post explains on a conceptual but profound level the purposes of commenting with some code examples.<br>
  It also outlines the different types of comments / documentation for code maintainers/co-developers VS code users.<br>
  It should be an advanced material for people who do a lot of coding in the lab.<br>
