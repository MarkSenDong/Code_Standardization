  Putting comments in code: the good, the bad, and the ugly, Bill Sourour
  This is a blog post which describes some general guidelines for commenting. 
  It is more advanced and detailed than the above material, but the concepts should be apparent to most of the people in the lab.

  How to document source code responsibly, Andrew Goldis
  This blog post explains on a conceptual but profound level the purposes of commenting with some code examples.
  It also outlines the different types of comments / documentation for code maintainers/co-developers VS code users.
  It should be an advanced material for people who do a lot of coding in the lab.
